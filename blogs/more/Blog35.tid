I started off loving Sony, then I hated them, now I&#8217;m almost loving them again. I&#8217;ll explain:</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m fed up with watching all of the torrents that I download on my PC in my study. I&#8217;ve got a 19&#8242; widescreen monitor so it&#8217;s not terrible, but in my front room I have a 32&#8242; TV and a projector, and I felt like it&#8217;s going to waste, especially as most of what I watch is downloaded.</p>\n<p>So I set about to use the <a href=\"http://www.dlna.org/\" title=\"DLNA\">DLNA</a> media streaming capabilities of my PS3 (this also works using an Xbox360):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I have a local wireless network onto which my PC&#8217;s, PS3, XBox360 etc are all attached. So I thought that this would be easy.</li>\n<li>In your PS3 settings you need to &#8216;enable media server&#8217; (or the like).</li>\n<li>Then on you PC you go to Windows Media Player (11, or Media Center) select &#8216;library menu&#8217; and then &#8216;media sharing&#8217;. From here you can set the permissions for your different devices.</li>\n<li>If your device does not appear you&#8217;ll need to either change your firewall settings to let media player through, or you can disable it all together.</li>\n<li>Make sure you add files to your library.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was now loving Sony. If you restart your PS3 (or search for media server), your PC will now appear and you can browse to files. Ahh, this is where you get a problem. The PS3 only supports mpeg media format. Now I hated Sony. You can do what some sites suggest and re-encode all of your files, or you can just use some other software to stream.</p>\n<p>This is where I discoveredÂ  <a href=\"http://tversity.com\" title=\"TVersity\">TVersity</a>. This works in a similar way in that you need to build your libraries etc, but the cool thing about this is that it will change the format of the file to one accepted by the client as it streams it, and you don&#8217;t need to go and re-encode all of your media. In other words you can now play all of your downloads (DivX, XVid avi&#8217;s) on your PS3. Cool eh. Now I&#8217;m kind of fond of Sony, but waiting for them to release more codecs for the PS3.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;ve had a strange day today.
